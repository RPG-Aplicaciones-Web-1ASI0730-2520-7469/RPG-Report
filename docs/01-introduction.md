## 1.2. Solution Profile
### 1.2.1 Background and Problem Statement

**Who (Who is affected?)**  
 The main affected are:

* Heavy cargo transport companies in Peru, facing high operating costs due to inefficient routes, vehicle wear, and accidents.

* Liquor distributors, who must cover economic losses due to glass bottle breakage and partial theft of merchandise during transport.

* Bar, liquor store, and restaurant owners, who receive incomplete or late orders, affecting inventory planning, promotions, and sales.

**What (What happens?)**  
 The logistics chain for liquor transportation in Peru presents structural problems:

* Truck fleets with an average age of 17 years (MTC, 2023), increasing the risk of failures and merchandise damage.

* Limited real-time cargo traceability: only 50% of logistics companies use digital tracking systems (Andina, 2023).

* Losses due to bottle breakage reach up to 3% of transported cargo in the beverage sector (Durán, UNI, 2020).

**Where (Where does it happen?)**

The problem occurs in the Peruvian market for alcoholic beverage transportation and distribution, especially on high-consumption interprovincial and urban routes (Lima, Arequipa, Trujillo, Cusco). The impact is greater on small and medium-sized transport and distribution companies, which lack resources to implement advanced technological solutions.

**When (Since when and how often?)**

This problem is persistent and structural. Although technological advances have improved efficiency in other sectors, digitalization in beverage logistics in Peru is slow. The problem occurs daily with each product delivery and intensifies during high-demand seasons (national holidays, year-end, regional campaigns).

**Why (Why is it a problem?)**  
 The lack of digitalization and logistical control generates serious consequences:

* **Economic**: losses due to breakage, replacements, theft, and delays.

* **Operational**: inefficient routes, fleet wear, and lack of traceability.

* **Commercial**: delivery failures affect trust between distributors and clients.

* **Strategic**: without consolidated data, it is impossible to plan inventories and optimize costs.

**How (How does it manifest?)**

* Orders arrive incomplete or late.

* Merchandise damaged during transport (broken bottles due to vibrations and poor stacking).

* Difficulty monitoring cargo location and status in real time.

* Informal coordination processes between carriers, distributors, and clients.

* Limited ability to react to unforeseen events on the road.

**How Much (What is the quantitative impact?)**

* Land transport in Peru moves more than 80% of national cargo (MTC, 2024).

* Fleet age averages over 17 years, increasing risk of failures (MTC, 2023).

* Glass container breakage represents up to 3% losses in beverage transport (Durán, UNI, 2020).

* Road interruptions cause losses of up to S/ 280 million daily in the transport sector (RPP, 2024).

* Digital models in logistics SMEs can reduce operating costs by up to 15% by optimizing routes and traceability (Cabrera-Gala et al., 2021).

## 1.2.2 Lean UX Process
### 1.2.2.1. Lean UX Problem Statements

Liquor transportation and distribution in Peru seeks to ensure safe and timely deliveries, but today this goal is not met. Operations depend on aging fleets and low digitalization, leading to bottle breakage, partial cargo and fuel theft, and delays. The market demands greater traceability and efficiency, highlighting the limitations of the current system.

Available solutions do not respond to this reality: they are costly, designed for large companies, and poorly adapted to logistics SMEs. They do not directly address the reduction of losses due to breakage nor facilitate coordination between carriers, distributors, and clients, who continue to face high costs and reduced service confidence.

The challenge, therefore, is not to create a predefined tool, but to propose ways to improve the safety and efficiency of distribution. We will know we are on the right track when we observe fewer losses, lower operating costs, and higher customer satisfaction thanks to complete and timely deliveries.
